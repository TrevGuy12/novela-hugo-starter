# Charting my Finances 

During the summer I did a [LinkedIn course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-essential-training-microsoft-365) on the basics of Excel.

The course was very informative, but I had no idea how to actually use what I learned.  Recently I have been trying to start learning how to budget properly and I realized that I could use Excel to give myself a visual representation of what I spend in a month in the form of a graph.

#  Getting my Data

In order for me to create the graph in Excel I need what I spend in a month, so I went to my credit provider.

The website allows me to download the CSV and import the data into Excel.

# Formating my Data

Once I had the data I ran into a small issue, The data I grabbed had to be restructured in order for it to be used to create a graph.

 After I had the information formatted it was ready to be turned into a graph.

# Graphing my Data

Now that all my data was formatted I just needed to make the graph, and Excel makes this process very easy.

With my expenditures graphed, I was able to see that most of my money went back to my work as I usually buy a lot of energy drinks.

So I just bought my energy drinks in bulk, buying them like this is a lot cheaper as the cost in bulk is around $1 a can whereas stores sell them a $3.39.
