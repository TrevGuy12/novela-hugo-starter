Overview of the larger project:

Overview of part 1: the training of the ML model.

(explain computer vision)

(explain training)

(explain what the model can do after its trained)

Steps:
Installing TernsorFlow model maker

Installation Validation

Installing setup tools

Installing tflite-support

Importing packages and logging

Step 1: Gather testing and validation images and label them

Downloading training images

Train the object detection model

Step 2: Select a model architecture

Step 3: Train the TensorFlow model with the training data.

Step 4. Evaluate the model with the validation data.

Step 5: Export as a TensorFlow Lite model.

Step 6: Evaluate the TensorFlow Lite model.

Download the TFLite model to your local computer.

Load the trained TFLite model and define some visualization functions

Run object detection and show the detection results

Compile the model for EdgeTPU

 Download the TFLite EdgeTPU model to your local computer and move it to the pi.
